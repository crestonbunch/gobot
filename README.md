# Gobot

Gobot is a Slack bot for playing go with other people instead of doing work.

Naturally it is written in Go.

## Setup

Create a [Slack bot](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) and copy the `Bot User OAuth Access Token`

Set an environment variable with your Slack API token

    export SLACK_API_TOKEN=<bot user oauth token goes here>

Or put it in your ~/.bashrc file (or wherever you put env variables)

## Run

From the project directory after cloning the repo

    go run ./slack/main.go

## Precommit

Install [pre-commit-go](https://github.com/maruel/pre-commit-go)

    go get github.com/maruel/pre-commit-go/cmd/...

and make sure `pcg` is in your path
